# BelleII-hadronic-reconstruction

This analysis is done in the framework of Belle II. 2 hadronic decay channels are reconstructed which are $\bar{B^{0}} \rightarrow D^{+} (K^{-} \pi^{+} \pi^{+}) \pi^{-}$ and $\bar{B^{0}} \rightarrow D^{+} (K^{-} \pi^{+} \pi^{+}) K^{-}$. The reconstruction is done first in signal MC. The samples are generated by running the MC scripts after adjusting the decay files. Then, the selection cuts on the significant variables are determined by fitting them (3 sigmas around the mean value) and applied on generic MC obtained from Belle II grid. The  analysis is done using basf2 software for the steering scripts, RooFit for the fitting, and jupyter notebooks heavily using matplotlib for visualization.
